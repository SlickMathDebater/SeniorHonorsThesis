\title{The Existence of a Continuous Function Whose Fourier Series Diverges at a Point}
\author{Raymond Maxwell Jeter}

\begin{abstract}
There exists a continuous function whose Fourier series diverges at a point. 
\colorcomment{red}{In fact, the set of continuous functions whose Fourier series diverges at $0$ is dense in $C([0,2 \pi])$.}
\end{abstract}

\maketitle

\colorcomment{Thistle}{Note to Dr. Ullrich: I'm colorcoding this thing. Black is text I half-think should go in the final thing. Pink-Purple are direct statements to you. Red is placeholders. Blue is exposition, which I'll need lots of help with.}

\colorcomment{Thistle}{I need to make sure that I'm not wrong about the history here. Do we have a book I can reference or something?}

\colorcomment{Thistle}{Speaking of references, what should I do with respect to citations?}

\colorcomment{Thistle}{I also need you to explain what a ``Modulus of Continuity'' is. The version of Dini's test we were given in class totally skipped over that explanation and just gave us the theorem I state below.}

\section{Introduction}

%Exposition here goes like this:
%Say what Fourier believed.
%State Dini's test.
%Explain how Dini's test covers a lot of functions, and that it's only just a bit stronger than continuity.
%Explain how missing this gap makes sense given the tools Fourier had.
%It look like it do but it don't.

\colorcomment{RoyalBlue}{The common story about Fourier's work is that he believed that every continuous function had its Fourier series converge to it. 
Now, observe Dini's Test;}

\begin{thm}
\colorcomment{red}{If $f \in L^1[0, 2\pi]$, $x_0 \in f^{-1}(\R)$, and $F(x) = \frac{f(x+x_0) - f(x_0)}{x}$ is integrable over some open neighborhood of $x_0$, then $f$'s Fourier series converges at $x_0$.}
\end{thm}

\colorcomment{RoyalBlue}{The condition required to apply Dini's test is ``Just a little better than continuity''; \colorcomment{red}{reasons}. 
So, it is unsurprising that Fourier could not come up with a counterexample, because most functions that he would have considered would have had Dini's test apply. 
In addition, the tools available to him that allowed him to visualize Fourier series would have utterly failed to accurately model any function that Dini's test does not apply to. 
So, it must have been very tempting to believe that every continuous function has its Fourier series converge.}

\colorcomment{RoyalBlue}{However, as this paper will demonstrate, this is not true.}

\section{Notation}

\begin{definition}
If $X$ is a metric space, $r$ is a real number with $r>0$, and $x \in X$, then $B(x,r)$ is the $r$-ball centered at $x$.
\end{definition}

To reduce the complexity of notation, we say that

\begin{definition}
$T = [0, 2 \pi]$
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
If $f$ is a continuous function, $n \in \N$, and $x \in \R$, then $S_n(f,x) = \sum\limits_{j=-n}^n c_n e^{-ijx}$, where $c_n = \frac{1}{2 \pi} \int\limits_0^{2\pi} f(x)e^{ijt} dx$. We call this the $n$-th partial sum of the Fourier series of $f$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
If $f$ is a continuous function, then $\norm{f} = \sup\limits_{t \in T} \{\absval{f(t)}\}$
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
For each $n \in \N$, we define $D_n: T \to \R$ by


\begin{displaymath}
   D_n(x) = \left\{
     \begin{array}{lr}
       1, &(n=0),\\
       1+ 2\sum\limits_{j=0}^n \cos(j x), &(n > 0).
     \end{array}
   \right.
\end{displaymath} 
\end{definition}

Also, we freely use the following well-known theorems:

\begin{thm}
\begin{displaymath}
   D_n(x) = \left\{
     \begin{array}{lr}
       \frac{\sin((n+\frac{1}{2})x)}{\sin(\frac{x}{2})}, &(x \neq 0),\\
       1+2n, &(x=0).
     \end{array}
   \right.
\end{displaymath}
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}
For any $f \in C(T)$, $(D_n \ast f)(x) = S_n(f,x)$. 
\end{thm}

\section{}

\colorcomment{Thistle}{I know you said that we don't need an outline of the proof first, but I think it's a good idea. Why do you think it's not a good idea?}

\colorcomment{RoyalBlue}{A rough sketch of the proof follows. 
First, for each $A \in \R$ we build a bounded, continuous function with some partial Fourier series larger than $A$ at $0$. 
We then consider sets of these functions with some partial Fourier series larger than some number at the point $0$.
We then show that these sets are open and dense. 
After that, we apply Baire's Theorem, which yields a dense, open set of functions whose Fourier series are unbounded at the point $0$. 
This dense, open set being nonempty yields a continuous function whose Fourier series diverges at a point.}

\subsection{The Construction of Bounded, Continuous Functions With Some Partial Fourier Series Larger Than A Given Real Number}

\colorcomment{RoyalBlue}{Inspiration for constructing the titular functions comes from the following theorem.}

\begin{thm}
If for each $n \in \N$, we define $c_n \in \R$ to be

\begin{displaymath}
c_n = \frac{1}{2 \pi} \int\limits_0^{2\pi} \absval{D_n(x)} dx,
\end{displaymath}

then $c_n \to \infty$.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}

First: $\absval{D_n(x)} \geq \frac{\frac{1}{2}}{\sin(\frac{x}{2})}$ if $x \in [\frac{\pi k}{6},\frac{5 \pi k}{6}]$ for some $k \in \N$.

This naturally yields the inequality $\int\limits_0^{2\pi} \absval{D_n(x)} dx \geq \sum\limits_{j=1}^n \frac{2 \pi}{6n \sin(\frac{5\pi j}{6(n+\frac{1}{2})})}$. 

\colorcomment{red}{*An illustration goes here*.}

Also, recall that for all $x \in T$, $x > \sin(x)$. 
So, $\frac{1}{x} < \frac{1}{\sin(x)}$ for all $x \in T$.

This means that we have

\begin{align*}
c_n &\geq \frac{1}{2 \pi} \sum\limits_{j=1}^n \frac{2 \pi}{6n \sin(\frac{5\pi j}{6(n+\frac{1}{2})})}\\
&= \frac{1}{6} \sum\limits_{j=1}^n \frac{1}{n \sin(\frac{5\pi j}{6(n+\frac{1}{2})})}\\
&\geq \frac{1}{6} \sum\limits_{j=1}^n \frac{1}{6n \frac{5\pi j}{6(n+\frac{1}{2})}}\\
&= \frac{1}{6} \sum\limits_{j=1}^n \frac{\frac{n+\frac{1}{2}}{n}}{5\pi j}\\
&\geq \frac{1}{6} \sum\limits_{j=1}^n \frac{1}{5\pi j}
\end{align*}

So $c_n \geq \frac{1}{30 \pi} \sum\limits_{j=1}^n \frac{1}{ j}$, and $\sum\limits_{j=1}^n \frac{1}{j} \to \infty$. So $c_n \to \infty$.

\end{proof}

\colorcomment{RoyalBlue}{It is important to determine how large a function's partial Fourier series can get at $0$. 
So we make the following definition:}

\begin{definition}
If $f \in C(T)$ , then $Mf = \sup\{\absval{S_m(f,0)} : m \in \N\}$ 
\end{definition}

\colorcomment{Thistle}{Hey, what if this supremum doesn't exist? One way to sidestep this is by going to contradiction-proof land, but there's clearly a better way to do that.}

\colorcomment{RoyalBlue}{So, we want to build a bounded function with $Mf >A$ for some $A \in \R$.
Constructing a sequence of functions, $g_n$, such that $Mg_n \to \infty$ would suffice.
We build this sequence rather naturally out of the proof of the above theorem.}

\begin{thm}
For every real number, $A$, there is an $f \in C(T)$ such that $\norm{f} = 1$ and $Mf > A$. 
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
For each $n \in \N$, choose $g_n: T \to \R$ with $\norm{g_n} = 1$, with $g_nD_n(t) \geq 0$ for all $t \in T$,  $g_n(t) = 1$ if $t \in [\frac{\pi k}{6},\frac{5 \pi k}{6}]$ for some odd $k \in \N$  and $g_n(t) = -1$ if $t \in [\frac{\pi k}{6},\frac{5 \pi k}{6}]$ for some even $k \in \N$.

\colorcomment{Thistle}{An illustration goes here, maybe? If I decide to make pretty pretty pictures it might be worth it.}

So, similar to the above,

\begin{align*}
g_n \ast D_n(0) &\geq \frac{1}{2 \pi} \sum\limits_{j=1}^n \frac{2 \pi}{6n \sin(\frac{5\pi j}{6(n+\frac{1}{2})})}\\
&= \frac{1}{6} \sum\limits_{j=1}^n \frac{1}{n \sin(\frac{5\pi j}{6(n+\frac{1}{2})})}\\
&\geq \frac{1}{6} \sum\limits_{j=1}^n \frac{1}{6n \frac{5\pi j}{6(n+\frac{1}{2})}}\\
&= \frac{1}{6} \sum\limits_{j=1}^n \frac{\frac{n+\frac{1}{2}}{n}}{5\pi j}\\
&\geq \frac{1}{6} \sum\limits_{j=1}^n \frac{1}{5\pi j}
\end{align*}

So $g_n \ast D_n(0) \to \infty$. In other words, for each $A$ there is an $n \in \N$ such that $Mg_n > A$, which gives us what we wanted.

\end{proof}

\begin{thm}
For every $\ep >0$ and every real number, $A$, there is an $f \in C(T)$ such that $\norm{f} = \vep $ and $Mf > A$. 

\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
There is an $f \in C(T)$ such that $\norm{f} = 1$ and $Mf > \frac{A}{\vep}$.

Observe that $\vep f$ has $\norm{\vep f} = \vep$ and $M(\vep f) > A$.

\colorcomment{Thistle}{How should I make M (blah) not look bad? Should I do parenthesis stuff, or just leave off the parenthesis and hope the reader gets it?}
\end{proof}

\subsection{Building Sets Such That Baire's Theorem Applies}

Next, we consider the following collection of sets: for each $n \in \N$, we define

\begin{displaymath}
E_n = \{f \in C(T) : Mf > n\}
\end{displaymath}

\begin{thm}
For all $n \in \N$, $E_n$ is dense.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}

We show that given $\vep>0$ and $f \in C(T)$, $B(f,\vep) \cap E_n$ is nonempty. 

If $Mf > n$, then $f \in E_n$ and $f \in B(f, \vep)$, so $B(f, \vep) \cap E_n$ is nonempty.

Next, if $Mf \leq n$, there is a $g$ such that $Mg > 2n$ and $\norm{g} < \vep$. 
Now, $M(f+g) \geq n$, so $f+g \in E_n$. 
Also, $\norm{f+g -f} < \vep$, so that $f+g \in B(f, \vep)$. 
So $B(f, \vep) \cap E_n$ is nonempty.

\end{proof}

\begin{thm}
For all $n \in \N$, $E_n$ is open.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
Consider $\la_n: C(T) \to \R$ given by

\begin{displaymath}
\la_n(f) = S_n(f,0)
\end{displaymath}

It is sufficient to show that $\la_n$ is continuous; $(n, \infty)$ is an open set in $\R$, and $\la_n^{-1}((n, \infty)) = E_n$. 
We do this by showing that $\la_n$ is Lipschitz.

Let $f, g \in C(T)$. Then we have:

\begin{align*}
\absval{\la_n(f) - \la_n(g)} &= \absval{f \ast D_n(0) - g \ast D_n(0)} \\
&= \absval{(f-g) \ast D_n(0)} \\
&= \absval{\int\limits_0^{2\pi} (f(t)-g(t))D_n(t)dt} \\
&\leq \int\limits_0^{2\pi} \absval{(f(t)-g(t))D_n(t)}dt \\
&= \int\limits_0^{2\pi} \absval{(f(t)-g(t))}\absval{D_n(t)}dt \\
&\leq \int\limits_0^{2\pi} \norm{f-g}\absval{D_n(t)}dt \\
&= \norm{f-g} \int\limits_0^{2\pi} \absval{D_n(t)}dt
\end{align*}

Because $\int\limits_0^{2\pi} \absval{D_n(t)}dt$ is constant given $n$, this means that for any $f,g \in C(T)$, $\absval{\la_n(f) - \la_n(g)} \leq c_n \norm{f-g}$ for some constant $c_n$; $\la_n$ is Lipschitz.

\end{proof}

\begin{thm}
$C(T)$ is a complete metric space.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
We want to show that any Cauchy sequence of continuous functions, $(f_n)$, converges to a continuous function.

$\R$ is complete: so for each $x \in T$, $(f_n(x))$ converges to a point. We define $f: T \to \R$ by $f(x) = \lim\limits_{n \to \infty} f_n(x)$.

Now: let $\vep >0$. Choose $N$ such that for all $n,m \geq N$, ${f_n-f_m} < \frac{\vep}{2}$. 
Then for all $x \in T$ and $n,m \geq N$, , we have $\absval{f_n(x) - f_m(x)} < \frac{\vep}{2}$.
By taking a limit as $m \to \infty$, we have for all $x \in T$ and $n \geq N$, $\absval{f_n(x) - f(x)} \leq \frac{\vep}{2}$.

So $\norm{f_n - f} \leq \frac{\vep}{2} < \vep$ for all $n \geq N$; in other words, $f_n \to f$.

Also, $f$ is continuous because $f_n$ is a sequence of continuous functions that converges to $f$ uniformly.

\end{proof}

\colorcomment{RoyalBlue}{By the above three theorems, we have that $E_1, E_2 \ldots$ is a collection of open, dense sets in a complete metric space.}

\subsection{Baire's Theorem}

\colorcomment{RoyalBlue}{So, we now have a collection of open, dense sets in a complete metric space. 
We want to show that their intersection is nonempty; a dramatic way of doing this is to show that the intersection is dense. 
A flair for the dramatic is necessary in life and mathematics, so this is how we should proceed.}

In order to facilitate the proof of Baire's Theorem, we prove the following lemma:

\begin{lem}
If $X$ is a complete metric space, $C_1, C_2 \ldots$ are closed, nonempty subsets of $X$, $C_{n+1} \subset C_n$ for all $n \in \N$ and $\diam(C_n) \to 0$, then $\bigcap C_n$ has exactly one point.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
First we show that $\bigcap C_n$ is nonempty: 

Observe that $\bigcap\limits_{i=0}^n C_i$ is nonempty for all $n \in \N$. 
So there is a sequence $(x_n)$ such that $x_n \in \bigcap\limits_{i=0}^n C_i$ for all $n \in \N$. 
The sequence $(x_n)$ is Cauchy because $\diam(C_n) \to 0$, so $(x_n) \to x$ for some $x \in X$.
Now, $x \in \bigcap\limits_{i=0}^n C_i$ for all $n \in \N$.
So $x \in \bigcap C_n$: $\bigcap C_n \neq \emptyset$.

Next, we show that $\bigcap C_n$ has exactly one point:

Let $x, y \in \bigcap C_n$, with $x \neq y$. 
Then $d(x,y) = \vep$ for some $\vep >0$. 
However, $x,y \in C_n$ for all $n \in \N$,
so $\diam(C_n) \geq \vep$ for all $n \in \N$. 
So $\diam(C_n) \slashed{\to} 0$, contrary to our assumption.
\end{proof}

\begin{thm}If $X$ is a complete metric space, and $E_1, E_2, \ldots$ are dense, open subsets of $X$, then

\begin{displaymath}
\bigcap\limits_{n = 1}^{\infty} E_n
\end{displaymath}

is dense.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
We need to show that in a complete metric space, $X$, that given a collection of dense open sets, $E_1, E_2 \ldots$, and a nonempty open set $U$, that $\bigcap E_n \cap U$ is nonempty.

We proceed by constructing a sequence, $(C_n)$, of nonempty, closed, nested subsets of $X$ such that $\diam(C_n) \to 0$, so that we can apply the lemma.

First, $E_1 \cap U$ is nonempty and open.
So there is a ball, $B(x_1,r_1) \subset E_1 \cap U$.
By taking $\vep_1 = \min(\frac{r_1}{2},1)$, we have $\overline{B(x_1,\vep_1)} \subset E_1 \cap U$.
Define $C_1 = \overline{B(x_1,\vep_1)}$.
Observe that $C_1$ is closed and nonempty. Also, $C_1 \subset U$.

Now, assume that we have constructed $C_{n-1}$, $x_{n-1}$, and $\vep_{n-1}$ such that $C_{n-1} = \overline{B(x_{n-1},\vep_{n-1})}$, $C_{n-1} \subset C_{n-2}$ (if $n >2$), and $C_{n-1} \subset E_{n-1}$.

Note that $E_n \cap B(x_{n-1},\vep_{n-1})$ is nonempty and open.
So there is a ball, $B(x_n,r_n) \subset E_n \cap B(x_{n-1},\vep_{n-1})$.
By taking $\vep_n = \min(\frac{r_n}{2},\frac{1}{n})$, we have $\overline{B(x_n,\vep_n)} \subset E_n \cap B(x_{n-1},\vep_{n-1})$.
Define $C_n = \overline{B(x_n,\vep_n)}$.
Observe that $C_n$ is closed and nonempty. Also, $C_n \subset C_{n-1}$.

So we have a collection of closed, nonempty, nested sets.
Also, note that because $\vep_n \to 0$, we have that $\diam(C_n) \to 0$. 
So $\bigcap\limits_{n=1}^\infty C_n$ has exactly one point.
This point is also in $U$, because $C_1 \subset U$.
This point is also in $E_n$ for all $n \in \N$, because $C_n \subset E_n$ for all $n \in \N$.
So $\bigcap\limits_{n=1}^\infty E_n \cap U$ isn't empty.

\end{proof}

\section{The Existence of a Continuous Function Whose Fourier Series Diverges at a Point}

\begin{thm}
There exists a continuous function whose Fourier series diverges at a point.
In fact, the set of functions in $C(T)$ whose Fourier series diverges at $0$ is dense.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}

Recall that 

\begin{displaymath}
E_n = \{f \in C(T) : Mf > n\}
\end{displaymath}

is a collection of open, dense subsets of a complete space, $C(T)$. 
So Baire's Theorem applies: $\bigcap\limits_{n=1}^\infty E_n $ is dense.
The above set is precisely the set of functions, $f \in C(T)$, such that $Mf >n$ for all $n \in \N$.
In other words, this is the set of functions whose Fourier series diverges at $0$.

Dense subsets of $C(T)$ are nonempty, so in fact there is a continuous function whose Fourier series diverges at a point.

\end{proof}

\section{Closing Remarks}

\colorcomment{RoyalBlue}{Consider the function we've shown exists: it rather obviously must fail the hypotheses of Dini's test, otherwise it would have its Fourier series converge. 
So, there's continuous functions such that \colorcomment{red}{Modulus of continuity is pretty bad}.
Now, \colorcomment{red}{Some examples go here.}}

\colorcomment{RoyalBlue}{Another interesting point to make is that the set of functions we constructed is dense. 
This means that any function can be approximated by a function whose Fourier series diverges at $0$. 
\colorcomment{red}{$\therefore$ lol.}}
